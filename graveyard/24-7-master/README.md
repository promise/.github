# 24-7

A Discord bot made public for educational and learning purposes. Feel free to use this in your code.

## Suggestions, bugs, feature requests

Want to contribute? Great, we love that! Please take your time on [opening a new issue](https://github.com/gleeny/24-7/issues/new).

## Contributrs

You can see all contributors and their GitHub-profiles [here](https://github.com/gleeny/24-7/graphs/contributors).

## Copying code

Afraid of copying our code? Dude, we love that people use it! But keep in mind, it is a proof of concept and also hard-coded, so there's almost no chance you can actually just copy the code straight in to your code. We love people who use our code, but we love it even more if you learn and get inspired from our code instead. What would the fun be in copying others' code?

## Config

Are you asking us why we've not added configuration to the code? We want you to make your own version. We do not recommend running this exact bot, it probably won't even work. This repository is published for learning purposes only.

## License

We use the MIT-license.

> A short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. There are many variations of this license in use.

Fetched from [TLDRLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license), please also read the [license](https://github.com/gleeny/24-7/blob/master/LICENSE) if you plan on using the source code. This is only a short summary. Please also take note of that we are not forced to help you, and we won't help you host it yourself as we do not recommend you doing so.
